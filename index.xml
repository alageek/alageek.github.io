      <description>We have turned our technology stack over the years based on experience. Our stack consists of Python, Django, .NET, Java, Linux, Celery, Elasticsearch, Git, and more.
Project management is a very core strength of alaGeek. We always try to find the fine balance between minimizing cost and minimizing risks. We have experience in Redmine, Jira, Confluence, Jenkins, Bitbucket Pipelines, Sentry, and Opbeat.
We are confident that we provide a very good mix of technological expertise, design flair, project management style, delivery focus, and integrity.</description>
